 1 Introduction
 **************
 .
 Netperf is a benchmark that can be use to measure various aspect of
 networking performance.  The primary foci are bulk (aka unidirectional)
 data transfer and request/response performance using either TCP or UDP
 and the Berkeley Sockets interface.  As of this writing, the tests
 available either unconditionally or conditionally include:
 .
 * TCP and UDP unidirectional transfer and request/response over IPv4
 and IPv6 using the Sockets interface.
 .
 * TCP and UDP unidirectional transfer and request/response over IPv4
 using the XTI interface.
 .
 * Link-level unidirectional transfer and request/response using the
 DLPI interface.
 .
 * Unix domain sockets
 .
 * SCTP unidirectional transfer and request/response over IPv4 and
 IPv6 using the sockets interface.
 .
 While not every revision of netperf will work on every platform
 listed, the intention is that at least some version of netperf will
 work on the following platforms:
 .
 * Unix - at least all the major variants.
 .
 * Linux
 .
 * Windows
 .
 * Others
 .
 Netperf is maintained and informally supported primarily by Rick
 Jones, who can perhaps be best described as Netperf Contributing
 Editor.  Non-trivial and very appreciated assistance comes from others
 in the network performance community, who are too numerous to mention
 here. While it is often used by them, netperf is NOT supported via any
 of the formal Hewlett-Packard support channels.  You should feel free
 to make enhancements and modifications to netperf to suit your
 nefarious porpoises, so long as you stay within the guidelines of the
 netperf copyright.  If you feel so inclined, you can send your changes
 to netperf-feedback <netperf-feedback@netperf.org> for possible
 inclusion into subsequent versions of netperf.
 .
 It is the Contributing Editor's belief that the netperf license walks
 like open source and talks like open source. However, the license was
 never submitted for "certification" as an open source license.  If you
 would prefer to make contributions to a networking benchmark using a
 certified open source license, please consider netperf4, which is
 distributed under the terms of the GPLv2.
 .
 The netperf-talk <netperf-talk@netperf.org> mailing list is
 available to discuss the care and feeding of netperf with others who
 share your interest in network performance benchmarking. The
 netperf-talk mailing list is a closed list (to deal with spam) and you
 must first subscribe by sending email to netperf-talk-request

 .
 This program provides getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo() described in
 RFC2133, 2553 and 3493.  These functions are mainly used for IPv6
 application to resolve hostname or address.
 .
 This program is designed to be working on traditional IPv4 systems
 which don't have those functions.  Therefore, this implementation
 supports IPv4 only.
 .
 This program is useful for application which should support both IPv6
 and traditional IPv4 systems.  Use genuine getaddrinfo() and getnameinfo()
 provided by system if the system supports IPv6.  Otherwise, use this
 implementation.
 .
 This program is intended to be used in combination with GNU Autoconf.
